# Open questions

Two experiments the 2026-09-21 runs make obvious but do not answer. Each carries a
**prediction registered before the run** and the result that would **falsify** it —
written down now precisely because this repo has already been burned once by a rule
chosen after seeing the answers (see `results/2026-09-21-shape-replication.json` and
the two live runs that failed to replicate it).

Neither can be run in a session that predates the deploy: MCP connections and the
agent registry are fixed when a session starts. Deploy first, then start fresh.

## Q1 — Does guidance work better in the RESPONSE than in the tool description?

### Why it matters

The strongest negative result in the repo is that a derivation recipe sitting
verbatim in a tool description was applied by **0 of 13 runs across two models**,
while the same text pasted into a prompt produced the right answer 3 of 3. That
comparison is confounded: it crosses the payload-in-prompt and live-tool-call
protocols, which are not comparable.

Moving the same text into the tool **response** isolates the channel cleanly. Same
delivery mechanism, same live tool call, same words — only the position changes.

If guidance in the response works, `return the computed figure` weakens to
`ship guidance in the response`, which is far cheaper to build, and section 6 of the
talk write-up needs rewriting.

### The arm

`inline` — description **byte-identical to `schema`** (one sentence + the typed,
`.describe()`d input/output schemas). The response body carries an `interpretation`
field holding the prose. **No alerts.**

That gives four arms off one base, differing in one variable each:

| guidance absent | in the description | in the response | computed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `schema` | `words` | **`inline`** | `rich` |

`schema → words` and `schema → inline` are the same text against the same base.

### Two sub-questions

**Q1a — does a FACT travel better in the response?**
Run on `total-vs-per-m2`, where `words` bought +6 on Sonnet (2/10 → 8/10,
p=0.0115) because the description contains the sentence the question turns on.

> **Prediction:** `inline` ≈ `words`. A fact that is already being read and acted on
> in the description has little room to improve by moving.
> **Falsified if:** `inline` beats `words` by ≥3 on any model. That would mean the
> channel matters for content the description was already delivering successfully,
> which is a bigger claim than anything currently in the repo.

**Q1b — does a PROCEDURE work at all in the response?** *(the one that could
overturn the headline)*

> **Prediction:** `inline` stays near zero on `gas-estimate`, like the description
> did. The model declines to execute arithmetic on the author's behalf regardless of
> where the instruction sits — the failure is about procedures, not about channels.
> **Falsified if:** `inline` scores ≥5/10 on any model. That would relegate
> server-side computation from "the only thing that works" to "one of two things
> that work", and the cheaper one would be in the response.

**Authoring caveat on Q1b:** the readable prose contains **no** gas recipe — zero
occurrences of `8.79`, `0.95`, `gas` or `boiler` in 6,099 characters. A recipe has
to be written for this test. Write it **once** and ship it in both a description
variant and the response variant, or the comparison smuggles in a second variable.

### Build notes

`ServerVariant` in `src/server.ts`, a `registerGetBuildingProfileInlineTool`
alongside the existing five, a `mcpInline` export in `src/functions.ts`, the
`deploy` and `logs` scripts in `package.json`, an `.mcp.json` entry and
`.claude/agents/eval-inline.md`. Add a test asserting the description is
byte-identical to `schema`'s and the payload matches `words`' apart from the added
field — the ladder's attributability depends on both.

## Q2 — Conditional interpretation: send only the guidance the data calls for

### Why it matters

A tool description is written before the data is known. **A response is the only
channel that can be conditional on it.** So this is not merely a cost optimisation —
it is something the description channel structurally cannot do, and it is an argument
for the response channel independent of whether Q1 finds any reading advantage.

The `INTERPRETATION` block is 4,338 of the 6,099 description characters, and most of
it is **mutually exclusive branches**: NTA 8800 / NEN 7120 + ISSO 75.3 / Nader
Voorschrift. Any given building matches exactly one. Roughly two thirds of that text
is always irrelevant to the record in hand.

### The arm

`inline-conditional` — as `inline`, but the `interpretation` field carries **only**
the branch matching the record's `berekeningstype`, plus field-level notes for fields
that are actually non-null in that response.

### Prediction

> Tokens down substantially. **Accuracy flat or UP** — not merely "the same, but
> cheaper".
>
> The reasoning: on `gas-estimate` the full prose was net *negative* on Sonnet, and
> the mechanism was hedging about district heating and metered data — material that
> was not about the question. Pruning to the matched branch removes exactly that
> class of noise.

### The failure mode that makes it a real experiment

Conditional guidance means the model never learns what it is **not** being told.

> **Prediction:** `inline-conditional` wins on single-record questions and **loses on
> cross-record comparison.** `benchmark-trap` is precisely such a question — its
> whole point is recognising that a NEN 7120 figure is not comparable to a measured
> benchmark. Prune to the matched branch and you may delete the sentence that
> prevents the error.
>
> **Run `benchmark-trap` in this experiment even though its ceiling is currently
> unmeasured** — it is the question most likely to show the cost.

## Token baseline, measured 2026-09-21

Mean `subagent_tokens` per run, from the runs recorded in `results/`. These are
**self-reported by the harness**, cover the whole subagent session rather than the
description alone, and come from a single sitting — directionally useful, not precise.

| arm | Haiku | Sonnet | Opus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `thin` | ~28.7k | ~37.4k | ~36.3k |
| `schema` | ~29.1k | ~37.7k | ~36.4k |
| `words` | ~32.4k | ~42.3k | ~41.2k |
| `rich` | ~31.8k | ~41.7k | ~41.2k |

The metadata layer costs roughly **3–5k tokens a call**.

**Note the ordering: `rich` costs LESS than `words`**, on both models, despite
carrying strictly more content (identical description *plus* the alerts). Consistent
direction, ~600 tokens, on both. The alert short-circuits the reasoning, so the
model writes less. Richer metadata is not automatically more expensive.

### Cost per correct answer — the denominator that matters

`gas-estimate`, at tolerance 8. Mean tokens × 10 runs ÷ correct answers:

| arm | Haiku | Sonnet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `thin` | 287k | 125k |
| `schema` | ∞ (0 correct) | 377k |
| `words` | 324k | 212k |
| `rich` | **32k** | **42k** |

**A three- to tenfold efficiency gap in `rich`'s favour.** The expensive thing is not
the metadata — it is the wrong answers you pay for and throw away.

### The honest counterexample

On `total-vs-per-m2` with Opus, every arm scores 10/10. Cost per correct answer is
then ~36k for `thin` against ~41k for `rich`: **on a question the model can already
do unaided, the metadata is pure overhead.** Any cost argument has to carry this case
too, or it is a sales pitch rather than a measurement.

## Suggested order

1. **Q1b first.** It is the only one of the four sub-questions that could overturn a
   standing result, and a negative costs 40 runs on one question.
2. **Q1a** next — cheap, and it calibrates how much of Q1b's answer is about
   procedures versus channels.
3. **Q2** last. It depends on Q1 finding the response channel usable at all; if
   `inline` is no better than `schema`, conditional pruning of something that is not
   being read measures nothing.
